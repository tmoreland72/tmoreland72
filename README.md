Hi there, I'm Troy Moreland (aka Graypes). :mask: :man_technologist: :wave:
</h1>

<p align='center'>
Currently, I am an independent, full-stack developer.
</p>

> :thinking: Fun fact #1: I started my programming career as a Marine in 1991.  I was originally taught COBOL and then spent the remainder of my 4-year obligation developing in ADA while helping support the largest connected network in the world (running Banyan Vines).  I spent time in California, North Carolina, Virginia and Okinawa, Japan.  ...funny thing was I wanted to be a sniper but scored too high on the ASVAB...

> :thinking: Fun fact #2: I retired from from my previous business, [Identity Automation](https://www.identityautomation.com) in 2019.  I built that business from a 1 person solo act to a 120+ person software company over a course of 15 years.  Now I'm back to coding and building tools and apps that I enjoy using in hopes that others will to.

I have kids in middle and high school.  We have been gamers since they were old enough to sit at a computer.  That is where I am "Graypes O'Wrathe".
