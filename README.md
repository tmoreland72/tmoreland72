### Hi there, I'm Troy Moreland. ðŸ‘‹

I consider myself an Indie, full-stack developer.  I retired from from my previous business in 2019.  I built that business from a 1 person solo act to a 120 person software company over a course of 15 years.  Now I'm back to coding and building tools and apps that I enjoy using in hopes that others will to.

### Currently

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects
  - KeeperRx - Take control of your medical life!
  - Conflux
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started my programming career as a Marine in 1991
